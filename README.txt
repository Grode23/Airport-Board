Στο παρακάτω παράδειγμα, τρέχει ένας Server, δύο Writers και δύο Readers.
Θα προσθέσω τα αποτελέσμα της κονσόλας από έναν από το καθένα, καθώς τα υπόλοιπα θα είναι κοινά και θα πιάνουν άσκοπα χώρο
Έχω προσθέσει πολλά μηνύμα σε κάθε μία από τις κονσόλες για να είναι πιο ξεκάθαρο που βρίσκεται ο κάθε client.
